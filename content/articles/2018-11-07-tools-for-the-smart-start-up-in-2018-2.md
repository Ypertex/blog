In my previous article, I gave you some ideas on how to leverage great but very affordable hard- and software to build [state-of-the-art IT infrastructure on a small budget](/articles/tools-for-the-smart-start-up-in-2018-1/). If you follow these ideas, you can outfit your team with the basic IT tools to work with: (virtual) hardware and hardened operating systems. 

That’s nice—but hardware and <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> alone won’t get you very far. What’s needed are applications on top of that basic infrastructure. Fortunately, there is a wide selection of software out there that is available for little to no cost. Let me give you some recommendations in the area of design, web publishing, GPS tracking, knowledge management, password management and more.

## Design

### Graphical Design

For a long time, there weren’t many options available in the area of professional-grade graphic design software. One major software company dominated the market, asking premium prices for their licenses. This changed when the software developer Serif introduced their [Affinity suite](https://affinity.serif.com/), consisting of the three applications **Affinity Photo** (for editing photos), **Affinity Designer** (for creating illustrations), and **Affinity Publisher** (for creating print publications, still in beta at the time of writing this article).

The Affinity applications come at a onetime payment of ca. USD50 each per individual user (volume licensing and discounts available upon request).
