In case you wonder what happened to my Twitter account: I deleted it in the larger context of the riots in the US Capitol.

The day after the insurgence, I read the follwing two offical Twitter statements:

> As a result of the unprecedented and ongoing violent situation in Washington, D.C., we have required the removal of three @realDonaldTrump Tweets that were posted earlier today for repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy.
> 
> {{<attribution>}}[Twitter Safety](https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1346970430062485505){{</attribution>}}

> This means that the account of @realDonaldTrump will be locked for 12 hours following the removal of these Tweets. If the Tweets are not removed, the account will remain locked.
> 
> {{<attribution>}}[Twitter Safety](https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1346970431039934464){{</attribution>}}

In other words: Twitter didn't permanently ban Trump from its platform that he used to fuel the riots (and many other things I don't agree with at all). As a private company, they'd be entitled to do exactly that. Yet they decided not to.

In my opinion, it means that Twitter is passively supporting Trump and what Trump stands for. **This is in violation of my core values.**

{{<figure src="b9298396-7588-40b5-90d0-2e09b3e92f3c">}}Where there's no audience, there's no stage.{{</figure>}}

**So while Twitter doesn't ban Trump, I ban Twitter.** A platform is only worth something with an audience, so I removed myself from that audience.

More and more, I realize that I want to grant whatever little I have (time, money, attention, ...) only to people that have their *and* my longterm benefit in mind. Social media providers less and less appear to be of that kind of people.

I invite you to do the same.

Even though Twitter ended up [permanently suspending Trump's account](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55597840) shortly after I wrote this article, I decided not to restore my own Twitter account.

First: While late is better than never, it wasn't good enough for me this time. Second: I enjoyed the past month with less Social Media. So I'll stick to it.
