## Assumptions Can Be Helpful ...

Think a moment about the assumptions on which you rely to get through a typical day in your life. Your routine on any given workday is probably based on the following basic assumptions, just to name a few examples:

* Your alarm will wake you up in time
* The transportation for your commute will function properly
* There will be the usual opportunities to get food and drinks throughout the day

Simply assuming these things—rather than verifying them one by one each and every day—successfully gets you through your workday routine. Sometimes of course, things don't work as assumed and your typical routine gets messed up accordingly. Generally though, relying on such basic assumptions has an **extremely positive cost-value ratio: You have more brain power left for the important stuff in your life.**

## ... or Detrimental

We are ready to take more assumptions (which might turn out to be wrong) in our areas of expertise. Sure enough, the more experience you have about something the more confident you are to simply assume things. On the other hand, if you have no clue about something, you are more careful and hold back with assumptions without verifying them first.

Unfortunately, there is **one area where we all continuously fall into the trap of believing that we're experts—while we're definitively not**:

> We all are experts in human beings, right? Everybody is one, after all!

This expertise in oneself leads to the "know one, know all" syndrome. Let me give you some examples that might appear familiar to you:

* A car driver disrespects the rules to your disadvantage. You swear at them since you assume they must be a disrespectful person in general to treat you this way.
* A parent doesn't seem to care that their children throw a tantrum. You complain, assuming that the person must be a bad parent in general to indifferently let their kids behave like this.

What if I told you that the driver rushed to see their child after it was just hospitalized with severe injuries? What if the parent just had suffered the loss of their spouse?

These examples might be a bit extreme—but show effectively that assumptions can lead to completely misread situations. How about more mundane examples? Maybe this sounds familiar: "Honey, how do I look?" Or: "Do you have time this Friday?" Or: "Are you kidding me?"

What do you answer? Without having more context, you need to fall back on assumptions: Maybe they want a compliment. Maybe they want just 15 minutes of my time. Maybe they think I'm stupid.

The last one is especially tricky as it contains an assumption about the assumption of somebody else: I assume that they assume that ...

Fortunately, there is a way to benefit from the "autopilot effect" of most assumptions while mitigating the inherent danger of the riskiest assumptions to mislead you: RATs.

## RATs: Riskiest Assumptions to Test

Let's come back to the important stuff in your life. Stuff that really matters like being a good partner, a good parent, a good leader, a good team mate. As non-experts in other human beings, we shouldn't rely on too many assumptions when it comes to these topics. The risk of getting misled and hence messing up the really important stuff is substantial.

> Learning is great. Learning the hard way not so much.

You've learned the hard way if it's tough or even impossible to recover from your mistakes. Imagine you assumed that your client knew exactly what they were talking about when they gave you their requirements for the project. Imagine that it turns out that your client *didn't know that they didn't know* what they needed. In most cases, this revelation comes pretty late when correcting mistakes costs *a lot*.

So instead of taking your client by their word, take the opposite approach: Assume that your client knows little and that's why they came to see you, the subject matter expert, so that *you* can find out what they really need.

Now imagine you have to work on a project with the boss of your boss. Are you still the expert? In many organizations, experts get promoted to managers because they were exceptional experts at the time. Saying "I'm the expert here, not my boss' boss" suddenly is not so self-evident anymore. How should you assess the quality of the technical input that you get from the boss of your boss? Considering the hierarchy, it's even more difficult to appropriately challenge the quality of input.

The answer is a process with four steps:

1. **Identify and formulate the assumption** that introduces the highest risk of failure.
2. **Design the most reliable and fastest test** that will produce a true/false result and upgrade your assumption to fact.
3. **Run the test.**
4. **Repeat.**

These assumptions are called <abbr title="Riskiest Assumptions to Test">RATs</abbr>. So if your client tells you "I know *exactly* what I need" you should smell a RAT and test this assumption. If your boss' boss hands you a project order with detailed tasks lists and deadlines, making it look like a well-thought-out plan, you should smell a RAT and test it. A shitty first draft doesn't become a sound concept only because someone up the hierarchy wrote it.

## Proper Testing

Step 2 "Design the test" is especially important. There is nothing more frustrating than having properly identified your riskiest assumption but having it improperly tested.

Let me give you two examples from my professional experience of how improper testing can look like:

### Case 1: Reliable but Late Test Result

In 2013, I was [working in a non-profit start-up](/articles/start-up-success-factors-trust-and-loyalty/) that was still trying to find a way to get profitable. One service we offered was the brokerage of micro-credits for educational projects between students and investors. The added benefit was that both parties could get to know each other, resulting in valuable relationships for both sides. Individuals but also foundations, the state or companies all could be investors.

We discovered that the vast majority of students that signed on for our service were highly motivated, responsible and entrepreneurial people, regardless of their field of study. We thought that we had created a talent pool that would be valuable for companies—so we designed a service for companies that included getting access to that pool of talented students.

The mentioned soft skills indeed proved to be interesting enough to some companies (positive test result to the first RAT). However, these companies had a very specific need: They were looking for early access to future engineers in particular. Our talent pool included almost no engineering students and we had no idea why this was the case.

The next Riskiest Assumption to Test obviously was:

> True or false: Engineering students in Switzerland require micro-credits just as much as other students do.

We never designed a *simple and fast* test to validate this hypothesis. We found out the hard way by putting a lot of effort into marketing for engineering students—only to realize way down the line that we couldn't generate sufficient demand and that our assumption was ultimately false.

### Case 2: Immediate but Unreliable Test Result

Later in another company, my team received a project order via our line management. The content of the project was nothing out of the ordinary. What made us a bit suspicious though was that the project sponsor didn't have the right management level to properly enforce the changes that would result from this project in the long run and across the entire company.

Vaguely aware of the concept of RATs, the team identified and formulated this suspicion as the Riskiest Assumption to Test already early on. We challenged the project sponsor to confirm that he got the necessary authority delegated to him for this project to be successful.

We got confirmation so the the entire team went on and put in an intensive month of work. After having collected feedback early and often from middle management, we took the next step and presented our concept to top management. That's when we found out the hard way that our project sponsor didn't have the support he assumed to have.

We were right in identifying the governance of the project as RAT. We designed a simple and fast test to see whether we were right or wrong. However, as we learned in the end, the test had delivered incorrect results. We had tested with the wrong person: Instead of testing the project sponsor, we should have tested top management as only this would have delivered a reliable result.

## Tips for Proper Testing

So what are the rough guidelines for properly testing assumptions? To give you some concrete ideas on how to go about validating your RATs:

* Observe what your test subjects *actually do* in their environment; don't ask what they *think they do*.
* Use prototypes and test environments to put people in situations that are as *close to reality* as possible. 
* If observation is impossible, ask the *persons who take the ultimate decision* on the topic at hand. Eliminate hearsay and the dangerous assumed assumptions.
* Make your tests as real as possible by having the persons *commit to something* (like a follow-up action) or *give up something* valuable (like more of their time). Do they put their money/time where their mouth is?

How would this translate to the two cases above? In the case of the engineering students, we could have offered them the micro-credits right away (with all the obligations that follow of course). Forget the usual marketing and especially the strict application process put in place to protect the credits–and get straight to the point: Here are loans without a lengthy selection process, who wants one? No student who doesn't have the real need for micro-credits would take on the related contractual obligations. We could have found out in weeks instead of months that there was no demand.

The case of the misaligned project governance is a bit more tricky. Not taking our project sponsor by their word and asking top management directly would have been an affront. Yet, we could have pushed harder towards a very early and informal feedback loop with the top manager that in our opinion would have had the seniority to enforce the changes resulting from the project. We could have found out in one or two weeks instead of one month.

## Conclusion

RATs are a great way to spare ourselves the disappointment to invest a lot of resources into something that nobody needs. I've started to systematically scan for RATs whenever someone asks me to dedicate a substantial amount of time or money to something. By testing these assumptions, people effectively **show, don't tell** me what they really mean.

Start smelling and testing RATs in your environment, too. This way, whatever's doomed to fail will fail early—leaving you and others to **spend more on what's well spent**!
