At [SRG SSR](https://www.srgssr.ch/en/), we're currently working on shaping the future of the CTO's department. We use the [Star Model](https://www.toolshero.com/management/jay-galbraiths-star-model/) as a basis to find answers to the following five questions:

* What's the **strategic direction** we want/need to take?
* What's the **power structure** that best advances that direction?
* What are the **information processes** that best support that direction?
* What's the **reward system** that best drives that direction?
* What are the **skills and mindsets** that best enable that direction?

This model helps in two ways.

First, it makes sure that all critical factors are considered. In my experience, some get forgotten way too often. It's especially dangerous to omit the reward system: Disregarding the reward system won't lead to just not having one. It'll lead to very likely having the wrong one---since all organizations develop an implicit reward system over time *driven by individual interests*.

Second, it makes sure that the last four elements all serve a single purpose: to advance the first element, strategic direction. Designing each element in isolation leaves a huge potential on the table right from the start. It's already difficult enough to keep these elements aligned once reality hits since they inherently tend to disconnect over time.

Following this model, we started with the strategic direction to build the fundament. We set out to define our [Ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai) and develop a common vision and mission.

# The Journey to My Individual "Why"

To know where you want to go as a group, you need to know where you want to go as an individual. Or, at least, it helps to know where you as an individual *would rather not go*.

In any case, there's no way around at least partially discovering your inner, personal direction. Hence these questions came up: Where do *I* want to go? What just cause do *I* want to serve? What belief do *I* want to follow? After all: Knowing one's followership improves one's leadership (see recommended reading below).

So, I thought about the four dimensions of Ikigai and how they would intersect for me.

## What I Love

I love to enable people to reach their next level---both as individuals and as teams. It's the best feeling to help others to achieve something they thought was impossible for them to do.

## What the World Needs

To overcome the next level of global challenges (like climate change or artificial super intelligence, see recommended reading below), our society needs individuals and teams to level up as well.

## What I Can Be Paid For

In my current role as Business Transformation Manager, I'm literally being paid to enable (parts of) our organization to successfully go through the Digital Transformation, advance to the next stage, and stay in [the infinite game](https://simonsinek.com/the-infinite-game) of public service media.

## What I'm Good At

It's a bit difficult to answer this question witout bragging. Still, as I've discovered over the past few years, it seems that I have one rather distinct capability: clarification.

True, it's less about directly bringing clarity. It's more about detecting and removing confusion or uncertainty. While the effect of the two is the same (*less confusion = more clarity*), removing the confusion and uncertainty is easier to do. It's addition by substraction.

(One could even argue that the formula actually is *a little less confusion = a lot more clarity*.)

In any case, this is what I'm good at apparently: Enabling individuals and teams to reach their next level by removing confusion and uncertainty. Now that I realize it, half the articles on this blog deal with ways on how to gain clarity!
