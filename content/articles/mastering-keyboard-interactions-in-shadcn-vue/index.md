In the realm of Vue applications, integrating UI components seamlessly is crucial for a fluid user experience. However, complexities arise when nesting certain components, for example when using the popular [shadcn-vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/) components. A common snag encountered involves keyboard interactions within nested components. Let's overcome this with a simple fix.

## The Issue

Consider a scenario where a [textarea element](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/components/textarea) from shadcn-vue is placed inside a shadcn-vue [accordion](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/components/accordion). It seems straightforward, but there's a catch:

The **accordion intercepts keyboard strokes** like arrow, home, and end keys to improve the accordion's accessibility. The same keys however are essential for navigation in textareas. So this behavior, stemming from the foundational [radix-vue](https://www.radix-vue.com/components/accordion#keyboard-interactions) components, is fine for accordions without form elements but disrupts the user experience as soon as you combine accordions and forms.

## The Solution

After delving into the issue, we found a simple yet effective solution. By modifying the form input tags, we can ensure that keystrokes are correctly intercepted by the intended element. Here's the snippet to integrate into your shadcn-vue form components (shown in the example of a textarea element):

```html
<Textarea
  @keydown.down.stop
  @keydown.up.stop
  @keydown.right.stop
  @keydown.left.stop
  @keydown.home.stop
  @keydown.end.stop>
</Textarea>
```

This code effectively halts the propagation of these specific key events from the nested form element, thereby preventing the accordion from capturing them.

In other words: Users can navigate again with the usual keys through their text input.

## Conclusion

Incorporating this tweak in your Vue applications will refine the user experience, ensuring that keyboard navigation within nested components functions as expected.
