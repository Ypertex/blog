summary: Last year, I shared a simple framework for making better decisions. Little did I know it would spark a journey that led to creating PrioMind, an app that's revolutionizing how we approach choices. Here's the story of how four criteria evolved into a powerful decision-making tool, and what I've learned along the way.

Remember that time I told you about those four magic criteria for [making better decisions](/articles/better-decision-making)? Well, grab your hard hat, because we're about to blow the roof off that idea!

Back in May 2023, I shared a framework for decision-making that centered around four key criteria: Potential, Strategic Fit, Capability Fit, and Confidence Level. It was a solid startâ€”like the first chord of a power ballad. But as it turns out, that was just the opening act. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the headliner: [PrioMind](https://www.priomind.com).

## The Evolution of a Decision-Making Revolution

PrioMind isn't just an appâ€”it's the lovechild of that original framework and a whole lot of caffeine-fueled coding sessions. We've taken those four criteria and turbocharged them into what we now call the **SOURCÂ·Eâ„¢** model:

- **S**trategy contribution (our old friend "Strategic Fit" was too lax)
- **O**pportunity and potential (our "Potential" criterion got an upgrade)
- **U**rgency (because sometimes, the early bird really does get the worm)
- **R**isk control (because what's life without a little danger management?)
- **C**apability fit (still keeping it real with what we can actually pull off)
- **E**valuation confidence (our trusty meta-criterion, now with a precise name)

## Why the Upgrade?

Well, the original concept lacked two important factors that kept popping up:

The addition of "Urgency" addresses a critical factor that our original framework missed: timing. Sometimes, options within your decisions may have an expiration date or a hard deadline that you or you simply can't work around.

"Risk control" emerged as an additional crucial consideration. While everyone will be happy with the best case scenario, not everybody can deal with the worst case. You want to know if you can live with the consequences if push comes to shove before you call the shot. (Oh, and since higher is better with every other criterion, too, it's "Risk control", not "Risk." You don't want your risk to be highâ€”but rather your control of that risk.)

Plus, this allowed us to turn the whole thing into a memorable acronym: SOURCÂ·Eâ„¢!

## PrioMind: Your Decision-Making Copilot

But PrioMind isn't just about adding new criteria. It's a full-fledged digital sidekick for all your decision-making adventures. Here's what sets it apart:

1. **Collaborative Decision-Making**: Gone are the days of painfully configuring polls to let you collect crowd wisdom. PrioMind allows teams to easily input their decisions and their options, fostering transparent and inclusive decision processes.

2. **Built-in Advisory**: Every big decision needs outside expertise. PrioMind's advisor feature lets you invite people beyond your immediate team to provide their valuable perspective. And the best is, advisor seats are free!

3. **Real-Time Insights**: As team members and advisors rate options, PrioMind crunches the numbers faster than you can say "analysis paralysis," providing instant visualizations of *top options* and *diverging opinions*.

4. **Decision History**: Every decision becomes a learning opportunity. PrioMind keeps a record of your choices, allowing you to revisit and refine your decision-making skills over time.

## The Road Ahead

Launching PrioMind feels a bit like sending your kid off to collegeâ€”equal parts pride and terror. But just like that original article was the starting point for this journey, the launch of PrioMind is just the beginning of a new adventure in decision-making.

We're excited to see how individuals and teams will use PrioMind to tackle everything from career moves to business strategies. And who knows? Maybe in another year, I'll be writing about how PrioMind has evolved to include holographic decision trees or AI-powered fortune cookies.

Until then, happy deciding, folks! May your choices be clear, your confidence high, and your PrioMind account always logged in.

P.S. If you're wondering whether to try out PrioMind, I've got a killer decision-making tool that might help you decide... ðŸ˜‰
