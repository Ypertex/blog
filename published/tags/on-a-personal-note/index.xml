      <description>For a blog claiming to primarily write about design (according to its current tag line “Design, Technology, Future”), I have yet to do so after three articles.

      <description>Finally. After literally years of intending to start blogging (the first design sketch dates back to May 2010, and I registered the Ypertex domains in December 2010), I am proud to publish the first post on my own blog.
Now what took me so long?
Lots of Reasons Not to Blog Content First and foremost, up until now I felt that I did not have anything really relevant to say to a broader audience.</description>
