      <description>If you ever have installed a virtualization platform like VMware Workstation or Oracle Virtualbox on a Windows 10 box, you might have noticed a different behavior since recent releases (i.e. release 1903): All the virtual network adapters introduced by VMware Workstation et al. don&#39;t appear anymore in the &amp;ldquo;Network and Sharing Center&amp;rdquo; and other parts of Windows.
I assume that for the majority of users, these adapters showing up in all possible places of the OSjust like regular network interfaces caused more confusion than it was helpful.</description>

      <description>If you followed the articles on this blog you know that I have a lot of love1, 2for JumpCloud.
However, there is a JumpCloud limitation that bugs me a little: It refuses to run on some Linux-based systems like Proxmox Virtual Environment or Openmediavault even though it officially supports the underlying Linux version.
Fortunately, there&#39;s a way around that limitation that I&#39;d like to share with you in this article.</description>

      <description>Splitting stuff is hard enough, but how do you move away the part that you just split off? (Image: Pablo Heimplatz)  Today was the first time that I needed to split one IPv4 subnet into two and forward the second half to somewhere elseâ€”without the ability to configure the upstream gateway. It took me a while to figure out how to achieve this with an OPNsense firewall as my router.</description>

      <description>Introducing JumpCloud In case you have not yet heard about JumpCloud: It is a cloud service that leverages user directories like Active Directory, Office 365, and G Suite (previously known as Google Apps) for Single Sign On in web apps and clients. My favorite feature of JumpCloud is its lightweight agent: Installing this little piece of software on Linux, MacOS and Windows clients and servers enables you and your directory users to log into these machines with your directory credentials.</description>
