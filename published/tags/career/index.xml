      <description>If you ever have installed a virtualization platform like VMware Workstation or Oracle Virtualbox on a Windows 10 box, you might have noticed a different behavior since recent releases (i.e. release 1903): All the virtual network adapters introduced by VMware Workstation et al. don&amp;rsquo;t appear anymore in the &amp;ldquo;Network and Sharing Center&amp;rdquo; and other parts of Windows.
I assume that for the majority of users, these adapters showing up in all possible places of the OS just like regular network interfaces caused more confusion than it was helpful.</description>

      <description>Assumptions Can Be Helpful &amp;hellip; Think a moment about the assumptions on which you rely to get through a typical day in your life. Your routine on any given workday is probably based on the following basic assumptions, just to name a few:
 Your alarm will wake you up in time The transportation for your commute will function properly There will be the usual opportunities to get food and drinks throughout the day  Simply assuming these things—rather than verifying them one by one each and every day—successfully gets you through your workday routine most of the time.</description>

      <description>In late 2012, I co-founded a company called EntrePreneurs (no, not really—I changed the name for the purpose of this article). While my long-time business partner adopted the role of CEO, I took on the role of CIO. We were off to a good start as our first year, 2013, was financially more successful than budgeted and our team had quickly grown to the size required to reach the goals laid out in our business plan.</description>
