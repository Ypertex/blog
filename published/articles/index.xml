      <description>In my previous article, I gave you some ideas on how to leverage great but very affordable hard- and software to build state-of-the-art IT infrastructure on a small budget. If you follow these ideas, you can outfit your team with the basic IT tools to work with: (virtual) hardware and hardened operating systems.
That’s nice—but hardware and OS alone won’t get you very far. What’s needed are applications on top of that basic infrastructure.</description>

      <description>Splitting stuff is hard enough, but how do you move away the part that you just split off? (Image: Pablo Heimplatz) Today was the first time that I needed to split one IPv4 subnet into two and forward the second half to somewhere else—without the ability to configure the upstream gateway. It took me a while to figure out how to achieve this with an OPNsense firewall as my router.</description>

      <description>We are not a start-up, so we don’t have the luxury of experimenting endlessly. How do you work within the constraints of our limited budget? Question from an interview at the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA This was a question I was asked in an interview when I applied for a new job after my start-up experience.
Of course, we all read and hear about the astronomical valuations of the start-ups i.</description>

      <description>Over eight years ago, I moved to Switzerland–a country with one of the most direct democracies in the world. This political system means that the Swiss citizens are regularly asked to vote on all kinds of governmental matters. Instead of only casting their votes every few years to elect their leaders, the Swiss adults usually receive once per quarter an invitation to vote on very specific subject matters. These matters can relate to federal, cantonal (i.</description>

      <description>Introducing JumpCloud In case you have not yet heard about JumpCloud: It is a cloud service that leverages user directories like Active Directory, Office 365, and G Suite (previously known as Google Apps) for Single Sign On in web apps and clients. My favorite feature of JumpCloud is its lightweight agent: Installing this little piece of software on Linux, MacOS and Windows clients and servers enables you and your directory users to log into these machines with your directory credentials.</description>

      <description>For a blog claiming to primarily write about design (according to its current tag line “Design, Technology, Future”), I have yet to do so after three articles. Let me change that today—but before I write about other people’s designs, I would like to first promote my credibility and address one of my own designs: this blog’s logo.
This article explains how I generally approach new designs using the example of the Ypertex logo.</description>

      <description>In late 2012, I co-founded a company called EntrePreneurs (no, not really—I changed the name for the purpose of this article). While my long-time business partner adopted the role of CEO, I took on the role of CIO. We were off to a good start as our first year, 2013, was financially more successful than budgeted and our team had quickly grown to the size required to reach the goals laid out in our business plan.</description>

      <description>As foretold in my blog’s opening article, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a topic that concerns me a lot these days. In particular, I am more concerned about the first and still imperfect Artificial General Intelligence and less about the potentially god-like, almighty Artificial Super Intelligence everyone is talking about.
For those of you who are not too familiar with the subject, I will start this article with an introduction and recommend a few links for further reading at the end.</description>

      <description>Finally. After literally years of intending to start blogging (the first design sketch dates back to May 2010, and I registered the Ypertex domains in December 2010), I am proud to publish the first post on my own blog.
Now what took me so long?
Lots of Reasons Not to Blog Content First and foremost, up until now I felt that I did not have anything really relevant to say to a broader audience.</description>
