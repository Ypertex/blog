<h2 id="assumptions-can-be-helpful">Assumptions Can Be Helpful &hellip;</h2>

<p>Think a moment about the assumptions on which you rely to get through a typical day in your life. Your routine on any given workday is probably based on the following basic assumptions, just to name a few:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your alarm will wake you up in time</li>
<li>The transportation for your commute will function properly</li>
<li>There will be the usual opportunities to get food and drinks throughout the day</li>
</ul>

<p>Simply assuming these things—rather than verifying them one by one each and every day—successfully gets you through your workday routine most of the time. Sometimes of course, things don&rsquo;t work as assumed and your typical routine gets messed up. Generally though, relying on such basic assumptions has an extremely positive cost-value ratio: You can run on autopilot for the little things and have <strong>more brain power left for the important stuff in your life.</strong></p>

<h2 id="or-detrimental">&hellip; or Detrimental</h2>

<p>The more experience we have with a subject, the more assumptions we are ready to take. On the other hand, if we have no clue about something, we are more careful and hold back with assumptions.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is <strong>one area where we all continuously fall into the trap of believing that we&rsquo;re experts—while we&rsquo;re definitively not</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We all are experts in human beings, right? Everybody is one, after all!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This expertise in oneself leads to the &ldquo;know one, know all&rdquo; syndrome. Let me give you some examples that might appear familiar to you:</p>

<ul>
<li>A car driver disrespects the traffic rules to your disadvantage. You swear at them since you assume they must be a disrespectful person in general to treat you this way.</li>
<li>A parent doesn&rsquo;t seem to care that their children throw a tantrum. You complain, assuming that the person must be a bad parent in general to indifferently let their kids behave like this.</li>
</ul>

<p>What if I told you that the driver rushed to see their child after it was just hospitalized with severe injuries? What if the parent just had suffered the loss of their spouse?</p>

<p>These examples might be a bit extreme—but show effectively that assumptions can lead to completely misreading situations. How about more mundane examples? Maybe this sounds familiar: &ldquo;Honey, how do I look?&rdquo; Or: &ldquo;Do you have time this Friday?&rdquo; Or: &ldquo;Are you kidding me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>What do you answer? Without having more context, you need to fall back on assumptions: Maybe they want a compliment. Maybe they want just 15 minutes of my time. Maybe they think I&rsquo;m stupid.</p>

<p>The last one is especially tricky as it assumes the assumption of somebody else: I assume that they assume that &hellip;</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is a way to benefit from the &ldquo;autopilot effect&rdquo; of most assumptions while mitigating the inherent danger of the riskiest assumptions: RATs.</p>

<h2 id="rats-riskiest-assumptions-to-test">RATs: Riskiest Assumptions to Test</h2>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Learning is great. Learning the hard way not so much.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&rsquo;ve learned the hard way if it&rsquo;s tough or even impossible to recover from your mistakes. Imagine you assumed that your client knew exactly what they were talking about when they gave you their requirements for the project. Imagine that it turns out that your client <em>didn&rsquo;t know that they didn&rsquo;t know</em> what they needed. In most cases, this revelation comes pretty late when correcting mistakes costs <em>a lot</em>.</p>

<p>So instead of taking your client by their word, take the opposite approach: Assume that your client knows little and that&rsquo;s why they came to see <em>you</em>, the subject matter expert, so that <em>you</em> can find out what they really need.</p>

<p>Now imagine you have to work on a project with the boss of your boss. Are you still the expert? In many organizations, experts get promoted to managers because they were exceptional experts at the time. Saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the expert here, not my boss&rsquo; boss&rdquo; suddenly is not so self-evident anymore. How should you assess the quality of the technical input that you get from the boss of your boss? Considering the hierarchy, it&rsquo;s even more difficult to appropriately challenge the quality of input.</p>

<p>The answer is a process with four steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Identify and formulate the assumption</strong> that introduces the highest risk of failure.</li>
<li><strong>Design the most reliable and fastest test</strong> that will produce a true/false result and upgrade your assumption to fact.</li>
<li><strong>Run the test.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Repeat.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>These assumptions are called <abbr title="Riskiest Assumptions to Test">RATs</abbr>. So if your client tells you &ldquo;I know <em>exactly</em> what I need&rdquo; you should smell a RAT and test this assumption. If your boss&rsquo; boss hands you a project order with detailed tasks lists and deadlines, making it look like a well-thought-out plan, you should smell a RAT and test it. A shitty first draft doesn&rsquo;t become a sound concept only because someone up the hierarchy wrote it.</p>

<h2 id="tips-for-proper-testing">Tips for Proper Testing</h2>

<p>So what are the rough guidelines for properly testing assumptions? To give you some concrete ideas on how to go about validating your RATs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Observe what your test subjects <em>actually do</em> in their environment; don&rsquo;t ask what they <em>think they do</em>.</li>
<li>Use prototypes and test environments to put people in situations that are as <em>close to reality</em> as possible.</li>
<li>If observation is impossible, ask the <em>persons who take the ultimate decision</em> on the topic at hand. Eliminate hearsay and the dangerous assumed assumptions.</li>
<li>Make your tests as real as possible by having the persons <em>commit to something</em> (like a follow-up action) or <em>give up something</em> valuable (like more of their time). Do they put their money/time where their mouth is?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>RATs are a great way to spare ourselves the disappointment to invest a lot of resources into something that nobody needs. I&rsquo;ve started to systematically scan for RATs whenever someone asks me to dedicate a substantial amount of time or money to something. By testing these assumptions, people effectively <strong>show, don&rsquo;t tell</strong> me what they really mean.</p>

<p>Start smelling and testing RATs in your environment, too. This way, whatever&rsquo;s doomed to fail will fail early—leaving you and others to <strong>spend more on what&rsquo;s well spent</strong>!</p>
