# About the Ypertex Blog

This repository contains the original content and the published articles of the [Ypertex blog](https://blog.ypertex.com/).

The original content can be found in the folders ``content`` and ``static``. The raw input from these folders is parsed and transformed into a web publishing format. This output is stored in the folder ``published`` from where it is served to the blog’s users.

# Transforming the Original Content

The [Hugo publishing platform](http://gohugo.io/) is currently used to transform the original content into a web publishing format. Hugo’s setup and configuration is maintained in the [Ypertex/blog-hugo](https://github.com/Ypertex/blog-hugo/) repository. The theme currently applied to visually enrich the original content is developed in a seperate repository called [Ypertex/inhabitu-hugo](https://github.com/Ypertex/inhabitu-hugo/).
